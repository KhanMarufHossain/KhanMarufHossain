## Hello there 👋
I am Khan Maruf Hossain. I am a professional **react native developer**. After almost a year of remarkable working experience and success as a junior developer in Sparktech Agency, I'm now working remotely helping visionaries worldwide.
Here are my best pieces of learnings & achievements:
1. **CODE QUALITY** : With the best react native development & optimization practices, complex logic buildings, such as Memoization, advanced relational caching I’ve reduced the loading time of a massive fetched dataset by 65% and made the user experience a lot better.
2. **PROJECTS THAT TALK FOR ME** : Assured enterprise-grade products for a large Real Estate organization of Dubai, a Football Journal app, a Petcare, a GOLF Diary for USA,  and quite a few other local startups.
3. **Language and Team play** : In WORLD LANGUAGE ENGLISH, I talk fluent, listen sharp, and connect with the problem by heart, making it seamless for clients. And in office & remote settings, I worked with team of backend, design, and project manager people, maintaining proper office etiquette and culture.

**I am a passionate coder**. I do it cause I love it. I have solid understanding in **C, Java **and** Javascript**.
My prime edge over others is I learn quick and execute fast. **I know how to search for the things I need to know.** I think that is the quality that makes me a genuine developer.
